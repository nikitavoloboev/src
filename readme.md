# ~/src

This is an experiment of trying to open source my entire code structure.

Need to look into git submodules more to optimize some things but this is a start.

`~/src` on [my file system](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/my-file-system) contains all my code. Some open source projects, some closed.

This is WIP project as I am figuring some things out.
