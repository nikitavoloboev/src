# ~/src

This is an experiment of trying to open source my entire code structure.

Need to look into git submodules more to optimize some things but this is a start.

`~/src` on [my file system](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/my-file-system) contains all my code. Some open source projects, some closed.

Below is contents of my `~/src` directory. Not all projects are mapped yet. You can browse code that is open below.

- [lib](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/lib)
  - [ts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ts)
  - [go](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/go)
  - [ui](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/ui)
  - [rust](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/rust)

This is WIP project as I am figuring some things out. Lots of automation needs to take place to make this workflow smooth to work with.

But it should help discovery of projects I work on.
